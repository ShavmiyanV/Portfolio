        Hi, I'm Shavmiyan, an enthusiastic and dedicated undergraduate student
        at the University of Moratuwa, pursuing a BSc (Hons) in Information
        Technology. Iâ€™m passionate about software development, UI/UX design, and
        creating digital experiences that are both functional and visually
        appealing. With a strong foundation in web technologies like React.js,
        Tailwind CSS, and modern design tools such as Figma and Photoshop, I
        enjoy turning ideas into user-friendly applications. I'm always eager to
        learn, take on new challenges, and grow as a developer while
        contributing meaningfully to real-world projects.
      </p>
